    <h2>A love letter to Whiskey</h2>
    <h4>A synopsis; </h4>
    <p>I saw him first. <br>
        But it didnâ€™t matter. <br>
        Because he saw her. <br> <br>
        
        He was my best friend, and I was his. <br>
        We couldn't be together, but we couldn't stand to be apart. <br> <br>
        
        And if you're not truly lovers... but you're so much more than friends... what exactly are you?
