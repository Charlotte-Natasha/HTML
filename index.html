            <h1>Let's get to know Me!!</h1>
            <p>I love memoir and poetry collections as much as I love romantic comedies. I'm drawn to a novel if it features strong female characters.So there you have it, then! I usually feel a little weird writing introductions, as if I suddenly don't know who I am or how to describe myself. However, I enjoy reading about other people in their introduction articles, so it's only right that I make an effort to comment occasionally.
            If you think we have anything in common or if you just want to tell me about your animals, let me know. I'm here all day, every day, for that information.</p>

                “sometimes courage isn’t climbing Mount Everest or changing the world. Sometimes your mountain to climb is made up of weekdays and months, made up of pushing yourself forward even when you want to nestle into the past. Sometimes changing the world means changing your world as gradually as you need to, as gently as you heal, because sometimes courage isn’t made up of war and bloodshed; sometimes courage isn’t made of combat. Sometimes courage is a quiet fight, a dim softness within you, that flickers even on your darkest days and reminds you that you are strong, that you are growing—that there is hope.”
